Task 3:
Create a simple chatbot that responds to basic user queries like "What's your name?" or "What can you do?" using machine learning.

Steps
1. Define intents (e.g., greeting, introduction, capabilities).
2. Collect and label training data for each intent.
3. Train a machine learning model (e.g., natural language processing) to recognize intents.
4. Integrate the model with a chatbot platform.
5. Test and refine the chatbot's responses.

Tools
You can use libraries like NLTK, spaCy, or Dialogflow to build the chatbot.
