Task 4:
Develop a simple image classification model using machine learning to classify images into categories (cat,dog).

Steps
1. Collect and label a dataset of images.(150 images of cat, 150 images of dog - manual labeling)
2. Preprocess the images (e.g., resize, normalize).
3. Train a machine learning model (e.g., convolutional neural network) on the dataset.
4. Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy.
